# Dynamic PRD Creation Workflow

- If there is text following the slash command (example: /create-prd [text]) use that text as the PRD name.
- If there is no text following the slash command, prompt for the PRD name.
- Begin with open-ended discovery questions (example: project goals, users, problems).
- Based on responses, adapt follow-up questions to clarify or expand on specific areas.
- As information is gathered, map it to the PRD template sections.
- If a section is incomplete or unclear, prompt the user with a contextual, specific question.
- Allow the user to review, edit, or expand any section before saving.
- Save the PRD into docs/prds and provide a summary of what was captured.
